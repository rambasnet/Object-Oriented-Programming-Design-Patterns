    "- use Mock to imitate objects in your tests\n",

    "\n",
    "## Imitating objects using Mocks\n",
    "\n",
    "- based on: https://realpython.com/python-mock-library/ and https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html\n",
    "\n",
    "- isolated problems are easier to diagnose and solve\n",
    "- if a test fails, diagnosing/debugging many interrelated components can be very difficult\n",
    "    - e.g., why the engine of a gasoline car not firing\n",
    "- we often want to isolate items and testing environments by providing simiplified imitations (facking real objects)\n",
    "- two reasons to replace actual code/API with imitation or **mock/fake** objects\n",
    "    1. isolate a unit under test - create collaborating classes and function so we can test one unknown component\n",
    "    2. test code that requires an object that is either expensive or risky to use; things like shared databases, filesystems, cloud infrastructures can be be very expensive to setup and tear down for testing\n",
    "    \n",
    "- unittest.mock module provides Mock base class for mocking objects\n",
    "- you can pass mock object as arguments to functions\n",
    "- assign/patch other objects\n",
    "- when substituting an object in your code, the Mock must look like the real object it is replacing\n",
    "    - e.g., if you're mocking `json` library and your program calls `dumps()`, then the mock object must also contain `dumps()` \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Mock must simulate any object that it replaces\n",
    "    - Mock creates attributes/members when you access them!\n",
    "- Mock methods can take whaterver arguments you provide but always return Mock object"

      " |  \n",
      " |  Create a new `Mock` object. `Mock` takes several optional arguments\n",
      " |  that specify the behaviour of the Mock object:\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  * `spec`: This can be either a list of strings or an existing object (a\n",
      " |    class or instance) that acts as the specification for the mock object. If\n",
      " |    you pass in an object then a list of strings is formed by calling dir on\n",
      " |    the object (excluding unsupported magic attributes and methods). Accessing\n",
      " |    any attribute not in this list will raise an `AttributeError`.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |    If `spec` is an object (rather than a list of strings) then\n",
      " |    `mock.__class__` returns the class of the spec object. This allows mocks\n",
      " |    to pass `isinstance` tests.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  * `spec_set`: A stricter variant of `spec`. If used, attempting to *set*\n",
      " |    or get an attribute on the mock that isn't on the object passed as\n",
      " |    `spec_set` will raise an `AttributeError`.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  * `side_effect`: A function to be called whenever the Mock is called. See\n",
      " |    the `side_effect` attribute. Useful for raising exceptions or\n",
      " |    dynamically changing return values. The function is called with the same\n",
      " |    arguments as the mock, and unless it returns `DEFAULT`, the return\n",

      " |    are exceptions they will be raised instead of returned.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  * `return_value`: The value returned when the mock is called. By default\n",

      " |    `return_value` attribute.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  * `wraps`: Item for the mock object to wrap. If `wraps` is not None then\n",
      " |    calling the Mock will pass the call through to the wrapped object\n",
      " |    (returning the real result). Attribute access on the mock will return a\n",

      " |  \n",
      " |  * `name`: If the mock has a name then it will be used in the repr of the\n",
