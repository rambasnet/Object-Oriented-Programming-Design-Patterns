    "\n",
    "- Topics\n",
    "    1. object-oriented meaning\n",
    "    2. difference between OOP and OOD\n",
    "    3. the basic principles of object-oriented design\n",
    "    4. basic UML and when it isn't evil\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object Oriented\n",
    "- Objects - real-world things that can be felt, touched, sensed, manipulted, etc.\n",
    "- Software objects are not tengible, but they're models of real-world objects\n",
    "- object is a collection of **data** called **state** and associated **behaviors** called **methods** that act upon the data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object-oriented analysis (OOA)\n",
    "- analyzing software design; modeling problem, task, or a system as software objects and their interactions\n",
    "- part of software requirement analysis to understand what needs to be done and how\n",
    "- find out what features that users/actors/stakeholders of the software need to solve the problem\n",
    "- this phase of software engineering may be better called *object-oriented exploration*\n",
    "- gather requirements, interview clients, understand business logic, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object-oriented design (OOD)\n",
    "- process of converting requirements into an implementation specification\n",
    "- name the objects, define the behaviors, and their interactions among each other\n",
    "- transforming *what* should be done into *how* \n",
    "\n",
    "## Object-oriented programming (OOP)\n",
    "- process of converting a design into a working program that does what the product owner originally requested\n",
    "- some popular development models are: **waterfall** and **iterative**\n",
    "- **iterative** is more popular in modern software engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objects and Classes\n",
    "- *object* is a collection of data with associated behaviors\n",
    "- *class* is a kind or *type* of object\n",
    "- Unified Modeling Language (UML) is commonly used to design the classes and their interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unified Modeling Language (UML)\n",
    "\n",
    "- used while explaining classes and their relationships\n",
    "- can be used document the design phase\n",
    "    - can be cumbersome to update UML if you use *agile/iterative* software engineering model instead of *waterfall/cascading* model\n",
    "- provides a common language to talk among developers, managers, designers, clients, etc.\n",
    "    - fairly intuitive to visually understand the big picture of the project\n",
    "- this resource provides a good overview of UML - https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/what-is-uml/\n",
    "- this resource provides tool to automatically generate UML diagrams: https://plantuml.com/\n",
    "    - text book authors used **plantuml** to generate all the UML diagrams\n",

    "- objects have members: \n",
    "    1. variables/attributes/states\n",
    "    2. behaviors/functions\n",
    "- a class instance is a specific object with its own set of data/attributes and behaviors (functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object attributes/states\n",
    "- objects have states; depicted by the value of specific attributes\n",
    "    - Orange has a state e.g., ripe or raw\n",
    "- attributes are frequently referred to as **members** or **properties** or **instance variables**\n",
    "- some may use strict rules that **attributes** are settable/read-write while **proerties** are *read-only*\n",
    "- Python doesn't have a concept of *constant* to make properties read-only; here use attributes and properties interchangeably\n",

    "- behaviors/methods/functions are actions that occur on object\n",
    "- like functions, methods accept **parameters** and may **return values**\n",

    "## Hiding details and creating the public interface (API)\n",
    "- key purpose of modeling an object in OOD is to determine the public interface of that object\n",
    "- interface is the collection of attributes and methods that other objects can access to interact with that object\n",
    "- other objects do not need, and are not allowed, to access the internal workings of the object\n",
    "- E.g., real-word example of working of TV and remote\n",
    "- this technique of hiding the internal details is called **information hiding** or broadly **ecapsuluation**\n",
    "- proper design of public interface is very important in software design as many other objects may depend on just those interface to interact with the objects and chaning them often may be difficult\n",
    "- interface is designed with easy of use in mind (KISS principle) and NEVER ease of implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstraction\n",
    "- another key OOD term related to information hiding and encapsulation\n",
    "- abstraction means dealing with the level of detail that is most appropriate to a given task\n",
    "- process of extracting a public interface from inner details\n",
    "    - e.g., a car's driver needs to interact with the steering wheel, accelerator, and brakes; everythin else under the hood is ignored\n",
    "    - mechanic works at a different level of abstraction\n",

    "## Class relationship types\n",
    "- there are three types of class relationships: Association, Composition, Aggregation\n",
    "- Association is the simplest of the relationship that tells how the objects are related\n",
    "    - e.g., many apples go into a barrel\n",
    "    - any one orange can go into exactly one basket\n",
    "    - a basket can hold many oranges\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Composition\n",
    "- important OOD principle; many design patterns use it\n",
    "- composition is: **has-a** relationship\n",
    "- act of collecting several objects together to create new one\n",
    "- composition is a good choice when one object is a part of another object\n",
    "    - e.g., a fossil-fueled car is composed of engine, transmission, starter, headlights, windshields, dashboard, sets, among many other parts\n",
    "    - engine in turn is composed of crank shaft, valves, pistons, etc.\n",
    "- an aggregate relationship is more general\n",
    "- a composite relationship is also an aggregate relationship but not vice versa    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Difference between composition and aggregation\n",
    "- the lifespan of objects can help differentiate the two relationships\n",
    "    - If the composite (outside) object controls when the related (inside) objects are created and destroyed, composition is most suitable.\n",
    "    - If the related object is created independently of the composite object, or can outlast that object, an aggregate relationship makes more sense.\n",

    "### Designing a computer-based Chess game\n",
    "- define the game of *Chess* - gather the requirments\n",
    "- *italicized* words are objects/nonns/attributes and **bold** faced words are verbs/behabiors\n",
    "- a *game* of chess is **played** between two *players*\n",
    "- *Chess board* is 8x8 grid containing 64 *positions*\n",
    "- *board* contains two sets of 16 *pieces* that can be **moved**\n",
    "- player alternate *turns*\n",
    "- each piece can **take** other piece\n",
    "- board will be required to **draw** itself on the computer *screen* after each turn\n",
    "- the following is the UML object/instance diagram representing a Chess system at a specific state in time\n",
