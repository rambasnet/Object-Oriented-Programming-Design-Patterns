    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- used while explaining classes and their relationships\n",
    "- can help us examine a problem from various angles\n",
    "    - understand and describe the problem diagrammatically\n",
    "- can be used as the document for the design phase\n",
    "    - can be cumbersome to update UML if you use *agile/iterative* software engineering model instead of *waterfall/cascading* model\n",
    "- provides a common language to talk among developers, managers, designers, clients, etc.\n",
    "    - fairly intuitive to visually understand the big picture of the project\n",
    "- this resource provides a good overview of UML - [https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/what-is-uml/](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/what-is-uml/)\n",
    "- this resource provides a tool to generate UML diagrams: https://plantuml.com/ automatically\n",
    "    - textbook authors used **plantuml** to generate all the UML diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4+1 Views\n",
    "\n",
    "- we can create a collection of diagrams using UML to help depict and summarize the software we're going to build\n",
    "- provides high-level views of the complete architecture of a software product\n",
    "- the views are used to describe the system from the viewpoint of different stakeholders, such as end-users, developers, system engineers, and project managers, project owners, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical View\n",
    "\n",
    "- a logical view of the data entities, their static attributes, and their relationships\n",
    "- the heart of object-oriented design\n",
    "- concerned with the functionalities the software provides to the end users\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process View\n",
    "\n",
    "- describes how the data is processed or essentially describes the runtime behavior of the system \n",
    "- can be of a variety of forms: state models, activity diagrams, and sequence diagrams\n",
    "- addresses concurrency, distribution, integrator, performance, and scalability, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development View\n",
    "\n",
    "- shows relationships among software components\n",
    "- can be used to show how class definitions are gathered into modules and packages\n",
    "- aka **implementation view** illustrates the programmer's perspective and is concerned with software management\n",
    "\n",
    "### Physical View\n",
    "\n",
    "- view of the application to be integrated and deployed\n",
    "- if the application follows a well-known common design pattern, a sophisticated physical view diagram isn't necessary\n",
    "- otherwise, a diagram is essential to show how a collection of components is integrated and deployed\n",
    "- depicts the software from the system engineer's point of view\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context View\n",
    "\n",
    "- provides a unifying context for the previous four views\n",
    "- often describes the actors that use (or interact) with the system to be built\n",
    "- can involve human actors as well as automated interfaces outside the system\n",
    "- the system must respond to these external actors\n",
    "- can also be called **scenarios or use case view** or system design view (a big picture view)\n",

    "### VS Code Extension\n",
    "\n",
    "- install VS Code extension by jebbs - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml\n",
    "- allows to preview UML diagrams using local or remote render\n",
    "- install recommended libraries following the extension documentation\n",
    "- configure the extension\n",
    "    - search for `PlantUML` in Extensions and click on `Settings` menu\n",
    "    - click `Workspace` tab set PlantUML: Render to `Remote`\n",
    "    - click `Workspace` tab set PlantUML: Output Format to `png`\n",
    "    - enter server URL: `http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml` in PlantUML: Server\n",
    "- to render UML diagrams:\n",
    "- on VS Code, create .plantuml file and enter `option+D` (Mac) or `alt+D` (Win)\n",
    "- to save image file:\n",
    "    - enter command+P and > PlantUML: Export Current Diagram and pick image type\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Local System and Makefile\n",
    "\n",
    "- to render UML images locally, must install **Java** runtime and **Graphviz** library\n",
    "- follow the instruction for your platform here - https://plantuml.com/starting\n",
    "- on a local Terminal type the following command\n",
    "- you must also download plantuml.jar file\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "java -jar <path_to_plantuml.jar> <folder/file.plantuml>\n",
    "```\n",
    "- it automatically creates <file_name>.png in the same folder where <file_name>.plantuml file is\n",
    "\n",
    "- see Makefile for demo: `demo-assignments/A1-OOP/Makefile`\n",
    "- to render UML diagrams run the following commands from the Terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd demo-assignments/A1-OOP/Makefile\n",
