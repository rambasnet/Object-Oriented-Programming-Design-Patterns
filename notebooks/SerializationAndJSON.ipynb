    "- one of the most popular techniques used by RESTful API services\n",
    "- JSON, as the name says, is more popular in JavaScript language to transfer data to a browser from the web server\n",
    "- JSON though popular is not as robust as the **pickle** module\n",
    "- it can serialize only basic data: \n",
    "    - integers, floats, strings, and simple containers such as lists and dictionaries\n",
    "- generally, `json` module's functions try to serialize the object's state using the value of the object's `__dict__` attribute\n",
    "- json provides **dump** and **dumps**, **load** and **loads** functions"
