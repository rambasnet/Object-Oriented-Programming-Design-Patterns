    "\n",
    "- programmers must know the importance of testing\n",
    "- strongly and statically typed languages (C++, Java) are usually safer \n",
    "    - type checking is done during compile time\n",
    "- testing is more important in Python\n",
    "    - Python checks for data/values not types; i.e., during runtime\n",
    "- *Software features that can't be demonstrated by automated tests simply don't exist* - Kent Beck\n",
    "- four main reasons to write tests:\n",
    "    1. to ensure that code is working the way the developer thinks it should\n",
    "    2. to ensure that code continues working when we make changes\n",
    "    3. to ensure that developer understood the requirements\n",
    "    4. to ensure that the code we are writing has a maintainable interface\n",

    "- Fowler's Test Pyramid seems to suggest unit testing creates the most value - https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html\n",
    "- unit can be a function, method, class or a whole module\n",

    "### Integration testing\n",
    "\n",
    "- confirm software components work when integrated\n",
    "    - make sure the major subsystems of the project work and play well with each other\n",
