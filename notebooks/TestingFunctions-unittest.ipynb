    "- strongly and statically typed languages (C++, Java) are usually safer \n",
    "    - type checking is done during compile time\n",
    "- testing is more important in Python\n",
    "    - Python checks for data/values, not types; i.e., during runtime\n",
    "- *Software features that can't be demonstrated by automated tests simply don't exist* - Kent Beck\n",
    "- four main reasons to write tests:\n",
    "    1. to ensure that code is working the way the developer thinks it should\n",
    "    2. to ensure that the code continues working when we make changes\n",
    "    3. to ensure that the developer understood the requirements\n",
    "    4. to ensure that the code we are writing has a maintainable interface\n",
