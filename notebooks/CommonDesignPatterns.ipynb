    "## The Observer pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "- useful for state monitoring and event-handling situations\n",
    "- pattern allows a given object to be monitored by an unknown and dynamic group of *observer* objects\n",
    "- the core object being observed needs to implement an interface that makes it *observable*\n",
    "- whenever a value on the core object changes, it lets all the observer objects know that a change has occurred\n",
    "    - by calling a method announcing the changes\n",
    "- widely used in GUIs\n",
    "\n",
    "![Observer pattern](resources/observer_pattern.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- at a high level, the pattern is also called `Publisher-Subscriber` model\n",
    "    - Publisher/Subject is observed by many objects called Subscriber \n",
    "    - any changes in the state of the Subject/Publisher are notified to the subscribers\n",
    "- observer pattern example using dice game: Zonk or Zilch or Ten Thousand\n",
    "- see `src/design_patterns/inventory.py` that implements an observer pattern for the dice game\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Open/Closed Principle**\n",
    "    - open for extension but closed for modification\n",
    "    - introducing new subscriber classes is much easier without making changes in existing publisher or observers' code\n",
    "- **Establishes Relationships**\n",
    "    - easily establishes and describes the relationships among objects during the runtime between the objects\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-dependency**:\n",
    "    - when multiple objects are dependent on the state of one object\n",
    "- **Getting Notifications**\n",
    "    e.g., social media, RSS feeds, email subscription\n",
    "- **Reflections of Object**\n",
    "     - objects are loosely coupled, the change of a state in one object must be reflected in another object\n",
    "\n",
    "- in the following e.g., every time the publisher changes its data, the subscribers are notified"
