    "## The Adapter pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "- designed to interact with existing code\n",
    "- adapters are used to allow two preexisting objects to work together\n",
    "    - even their interfaces are not compatible\n",
    "- just like the hardware adapter that helps two differnt devices talk to each other\n",
    "    - adapter object sits between two interfaces/objects tranlating between them on the fly\n",
    "- adapter may perform various tasks:\n",
    "    - converting parameters to different formats\n",
    "    - rearranging the order of arguments\n",
    "    - calling a different named method\n",
    "    - suppying default arguments\n",
    "- conceptually, similar to the Decorator pattern\n",
    "    - decorators provide the same interface that they replace\n",
    "- example from: https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter/python/example"
