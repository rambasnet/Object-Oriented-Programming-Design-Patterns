    "## SOLID principle\n",
    "\n",
    "- a popular software design principle using OOP\n",
    "- must know it by heart!\n",
    "- it's a great starting point of OOD\n",
    "\n",
    "### S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)\n",
    "\n",
    "- a class should have one responsibility\n",
    "- \"one and only reason\" to change when the requirements change\n",
    "- a class should have a single, well-defined purpose; should be responsible for one aspect of the system's functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to Achieve the Single Responsibility Principle:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Identify Responsibilities**:\n",
    "    - carefully analyze the responsibilities of each class in your design\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Separate Concerns**: \n",
    "    - if a class has multiple responsibilities, break it down into smaller classes, each with a single responsibility\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Use Cohesion**:\n",
    "    - aim for high cohesion within classes, meaning that all the elements within a class should be related to its single responsibility\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Avoid God Objects**:\n",
    "    - \"God objects\" are classes that try to do everything\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Refactor**: \n",
    "    - if you find that a class is violating the SRP, refactor it to separate its responsibilities\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### What does \"reason to change\" mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A \"reason to change\" refers to a specific actor or requirement that could cause the class to be modified; e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A class that handles both data persistence and user interface logic has two reasons to change: changes in the database schema and changes in the UI design\n",
    "    - A class that both calculates employee salary and generates reports has two reasons to change: changes in salary calculation rules and changes in report formatting"
